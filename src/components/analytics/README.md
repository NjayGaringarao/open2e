# Simplified Analytics Dashboard

This analytics dashboard has been simplified to show clear, empty content by default and only display data when users start inputting evaluations.

## Features

### Core Analytics (Only shown when data exists)
- **Total number of answers evaluated** - Count of all evaluations
- **Overall average score** - Average score across all evaluations  
- **Average score per question** - Breakdown of scores by individual questions
- **Evaluations over time** - Line/area chart showing evaluation trends

### Empty State
When no evaluations exist, the dashboard shows:
- Clear messaging about what analytics will display
- Instructions to start evaluating answers
- Professional, clean interface without clutter

### Extensibility
The system is designed to easily add future analytics:
- Modular component structure
- Reusable chart components
- Type-safe data interfaces
- Simple tab-based navigation

## Component Structure

- `AnalyticsDashboard` - Main dashboard with empty state handling

## Data Flow
