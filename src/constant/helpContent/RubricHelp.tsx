## Getting Started
This page will allow you to view, and manage the scoring criteria (analytical rubrics) that you can use for evaluations. Open2E provides a default rubric for you to use, but you can create your own custom rubrics to suit your needs.

---
### Rubric List
1. **View Rubric**: Click on any rubric name (e.g., **Default Rubric**) to view its details and score brackets.
2. **Create New Rubric**: Press the **+ Create New Rubric** button to define a new set of scoring rules.
3. **Delete Rubric**: Click the **trash icon** (ðŸ—‘) next to a custom rubric to remove it from the system.

---
## Viewing a Rubric
This screen provides a list of your scoring models. Each Item's full details can be viewed by clicking on the item.
* **Rubric Name**: The name of the rubric.
* **Total Score**: The total score of the rubric.
* **Score Brackets**: Review the quality descriptions associated with each point range.
* **Additional Notes**: Check for any specific instructional rules the AI must follow during evaluation.

## Creating a New Rubric
Use this form to build a detailed scoring guide for the AI.

1. **Set Basics**: Provide a **Rubric Name** and define the **Total Score** (e.g., 10, 20).
2. **Define Score Brackets**:
    * Click **+ Add Score Bracket** to define a range of points (e.g., 0-4 points, 5-7 points).
    * For each bracket, write a clear, detailed criteria of the expected answer quality to earn that score.
3. **Additional Notes (Optional)**: Use this space for any special grading instructions for the AI, such as rules for proportional scoring.
4. **Ensure Coverage**: The **Score Coverage** bar must reach **100% Complete**. This means you have defined descriptions for every possible point from 0 up to your Total Score.
5. **Save**: Click **Save Rubric** once all ranges are covered.

> Note: Detailed, specific score bracket descriptions lead to more accurate and reliable AI evaluations.
