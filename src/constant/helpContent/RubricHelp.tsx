## Creating a New Rubric
Use this form to build a detailed scoring guide for the AI.

1. **Set Basics**: Provide a **Rubric Name** and define the **Total Score** (e.g., 10, 20).
2. **Define Score Brackets**:
    * Click **+ Add Score Bracket** to define a range of points (e.g., 0-4 points, 5-7 points).
    * For each bracket, write a clear, detailed criteria of the expected answer quality to earn that score.
3. **Additional Notes (Optional)**: Use this space for any special grading instructions for the AI, such as rules for proportional scoring.
4. **Ensure Coverage**: The **Score Coverage** bar must reach **100% Complete**. This means you have defined descriptions for every possible point from 0 up to your Total Score.
5. **Save**: Click **Save Rubric** once all ranges are covered.
